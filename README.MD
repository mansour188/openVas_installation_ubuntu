## What is Greenbone Security Assistant?
Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA) is a powerful web-based user interface designed to manage the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework. GSA provides users with the ability to configure scans, manage assets, and view detailed reports on vulnerabilities detected in networked systems.

## Components and Utilities

### Dashboards
The dashboard provides an overview of the security status, including tasks by severity class, tasks by status, CVEs by creation time, and NVTs by severity class.

### Scans
Manage and configure vulnerability scans, view scan results, and generate reports.

### Assets
Manage networked assets, including hosts and networks, and view their security status.

### Resilience
Configure and manage resilience settings to ensure continuous security monitoring.

### SecInfo
Access detailed security information, including vulnerability details and security advisories.

### Configuration
Manage system settings, including user accounts, scan configurations, and report formats.

### Administration
Administer the GSA, including system updates and maintenance tasks.
